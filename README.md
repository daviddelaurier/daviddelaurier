- 👋 Hi, I’m David DeLaurier
- 👀 I’m interested in automating all work performed by humans interacting with computer interfaces. The first step in that direction is transitioning from visual UI design to Audio/Tactile UI.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to train my pottery assistant Cobot robot arms using IsiacSim via video demonstration training.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a hardware device running computer vision models and telephoto camera system that tracks eye positioning of drivers to determin if they looked at the advertisment long enough to be effective. Gathering accurate and up-to-date impression data for the outdoor advertising industry is worth billions.
