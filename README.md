- 👋 Hi, I’m @daviddelaurier
- 👀 I’m interested in automating all work performed by humans interacting with computer interfaces.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to train my Cobot arms using IsiacSim
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a hardware device running computer vision models and telephoto camera system that tracks eye positioning of drivers to determin if they looked at the advertisment long enough to be effective. Gathering accurate and up-to-date impression data for the outdoor advertising industry is worth billions.
